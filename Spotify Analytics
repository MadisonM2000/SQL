# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#1. List only songs that feature a second artist

SELECT track_name
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat%'
OR track_name LIKE '%with%'
AND track_name NOT LIKE 'without you';

# 12. select top 10 most popular artists based on average 

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
order by avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
