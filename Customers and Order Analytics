AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM bit_db.jansales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JANSALES
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) AS customers, AVG(quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM bit_db.febsales AS sales
LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers AS customers
ON customers.order_id = sales.orderid
WHERE sales.quantity >2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
